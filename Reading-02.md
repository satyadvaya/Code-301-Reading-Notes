# Read 02: _Components, Classes and Callbacks_
## Applying Atomic Design
Atomic design employs deconstruction and reductionism in visually breaking down page elements into increasingly smaller elements, and reversing the effort when transforming UI features and building out components to compose redesigned functional and visual units.  Match UI components with individual pieces of your data model, since they both tend to adhere to the same information architecture, and arrange them into a hierarchy.  Adopt a common language based on components across design and development.

## Callbacks
Callbacks are higher-order functions which are passed as arguments or parameters and are both called by, as well as run inside of, functions that call and receive them to complete a routine or action.  They ensure that certain code won't execute before other code has successfully executed.
