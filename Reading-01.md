# Read 01: _JS Templates and Array .forEach method_

## JS Templates
The use of multi-line strings and string inerpolation with `template literal` embedded expressions makes substitutions more readable.  

## Array Methods
The `.forEach()` method doesn't mutate the array on which its called, although a callback function may, and you need to throw an exception in order to stop or break a `.forEach()` loop.  The `.forEach()` method only works on arrays, so the `for loop` would be better if you want to count, although the callback function with `.forEach()` methods accepts the arguments of element value, element index, and array being traversed.
